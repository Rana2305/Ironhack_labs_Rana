
1 we can use data.describe() to look at the features of the data.
2 we can use data.head() to see the first five rows.
 we can drop the column Department and rename.
 we can rename the wrong data type 
like Student, and student, etudient
Manager, manager
BDM, bdm
HR, hr

3 Data cleansing (missing values, outliers)
   - we should look at the missing values
first, we find the number of missing values in each column.
-I replaced the missing values of profession by BDM beacause these observations belong to the same client.
-2 I replaced the missing values of Birthyear by other values in the same column.

   
    -For the outliers

  -There are two children clients born in 2017 and in 2015.

   I droped the 2 rows.


3 Encode categorical data

I encoded two different variables Profession and Risk.
